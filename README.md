# Snippet simulating the Reverse Labouchere system

There is a famous roulette strategy called Martingale and many people think they can make money with it. The Reverse Labouchere is supposedly an improved version of it. The code clearly shows that in the long run you will always lose money. This code even attempts to implement a stop loss. The stop loss does stop you from losing all of your money, but it is still a very unprofitable system. Also, the whole thing is run on truly 50% chance of winning probability, which no casino would ever give you.
