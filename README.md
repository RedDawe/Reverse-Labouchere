# Snippet simulating the Reverse Labouchere system

There is a famous roulette strategy called Martingale and many people think they can make money with it. The Reverse Labouchere is supposedly an improved version of it. The code clearly shows that in the long run you will always lose money. This code even attempts to implement a stop loss. The stop loss does stop you from losing all of your money, but it is still a very unprofitable system.

The exact logic is described in [this blog](https://nononsenseforex.com/uncategorized/reverse-labouchere/).

50% win probability is used, but the casino takes 10% of your profits. (no zero roulette)

You can turn off the stop loss by setting it to an unreasonably high number.
